        <h1>Overwrite</h1>

        <p>
            Overwrite is a program that overwrites empty space on disk, 
            data and metadata.
        </p>

        <img src="../../images/overwrite-ui.png" alt="Overwrite" />

        <p>
            The empty space on disk can contain <strong>sensitive data</strong> and information that can be 
            recovered with recovery software and <strong>forensic</strong>, this can be 
           <strong>privacy and security risk</strong>.

        </p>

        <p>
            The operating systems and programs automatically write and delete data on disk, 
            for example text editors may save copies of the document for recovery and later delete them.
            Also when users delete files they are only marked as deleted but the files remain on disk and can be recovered.
        </p>

        <p>
            To protect privacy and security the remaining data on empty space on disk 
            <strong>has to be overwritten</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            To properly clean remaining data both metadata as file names and content 
            has to be overwritten, this program has parameters as -dirs and -data that 
            specify quantity of <strong>metadata and data</strong> has to be overwritten.
        </p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It is <strong>safe</strong>, does not overwrite existing files, and use operating system for 
                overwrite.

            </li>
            <li>Can be used on different file systems and operating systems, as NTFS EXT4 FAT Windows Linux.

            </li>
            <li>Different options can be specified, as block size, number of files, quantity of data.

            </li>
            <li>It is free and open source with general public licence.

            </li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Download</h2>

        <p>
            Source code and executables for different architectures and operating systems can be 
            found in code repositories.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overwrite program is written in C programming language it is contained in one 
            file, can be compiled on different operating systems and also can be 
            used without compilation, the source code can be run directly with 
            Tiny C compiler ex: tcc -run overwrite.c

        <h2>Usage</h2>

        <pre>
Overwrite empty space on disk, metadata and data. 

USAGE: 
overwrite [-h -v -test -one -rand -block:] (-dirs: &| -data:) -path: 
  -h 		 Print help and usage message. 
  -v 		 Print program version. 
  -test 	 For test, don't delete written files. 
  -one 		 Overwrite with 1, default with 0. 
  -rand 	 Overwrite with random data, default with 0. 
  -block 	 Block size, default 4096 bytes as NTFS and EXT4. 
  -dirs 	 Number of directories to write, ex: 10, 100.
  -data 	 Quantity of data to write, ex: 1mb, 1gb, all. 
  -path 	 Path to directory where to write files. 

EXAMPLE: 
Write 10 dirs and 10Mb data, on Windows 
overwrite -dirs:10 -data:10mb -path:c:\ 

Write random data, block size 512 bytes on Linux 
overwrite -rand -block:512 -data:10mb -path:/mnt/usbdisk/

            <strong>Metadata</strong>
            <br />
            Overwrite metadata 10 entries/files
            <br />
            overwrite -dirs:10 -path:c:\
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Data</strong>
            <br />
            Overwrite data all empty space
            <br />
            overwrite -data:all -path:c:\
        </p>

        <h2>How it works</h2>

        <p>
            Overwrite program write files and directories using operating system functions, 
            and in this way overwrite the remaining metadata and data on disk.

        </p>
        <p>
            When operating system delete file the file and space used by 
            it is marked as free for new files, 
            but the data is not cleaned and remain on disk, 
            so when the new files are written the remaining data is overwritten.

        </p>
        <p>
            The file system is similar to dictionary has metadata that is 
            summary information about the files and then data, writing many 
            directories overwrite metadata, and writing big file overwrite data, 
            that is what overwrite program does.

        </p>


        <h2>Side Effects</h2>
        <p>
            Overwrite of metadata is not always guaranteed, this depends on different factors as number 
            of files written, file system.
            <br />
            For example on FAT file system metadata has to be overwritten in the same directory of the 
            deleted files.  

        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Metadata should not be filled all at once</strong>
            , the parameter -dirs should be 
            number of files to overwrite for example 100, 1000, it is not good practice more 
            than 10.000.
            <br />
            NTFS file system on Windows metadata structure grow for maximum number 
            of files written at one poin in time, when files are deleted 
            metadata entries are marked as free and ready for new files 
            but space is not released.
