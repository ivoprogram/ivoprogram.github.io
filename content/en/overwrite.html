        <h1>Overwrite program</h1>

        <p>
            Overwrite is a program that overwrites empty space on disk, 
            data and metadata.
        </p>

        <img src="../../images/overwrite-windows-ui.png" alt="Overwrite" />

        <p>
            The empty space on disk can contain <strong>sensitive data</strong> and information that can be 
            recovered with recovery software and <strong>forensic</strong>, this can be 
           <strong>privacy and security risk</strong>.

        </p>

        <p>
            The operating systems and programs automatically write and delete data on disk, 
            for example text editors may save copies of the document for recovery and later delete them.
            Also when users delete files they are only marked as deleted but the files remain on disk and can be recovered.
        </p>

        <p>
            To protect privacy and security the remaining data on empty space on disk 
            <strong>has to be overwritten</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            To properly clean remaining data both metadata as file names and content 
            has to be overwritten, this program has parameters as -dirs and -data that 
            specify quantity of <strong>metadata and data</strong> has to be overwritten.
        </p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It is <strong>safe</strong>, does not overwrite existing files, and use operating system for 
                overwrite.

            </li>
            <li>Can be used on different file systems and operating systems, as NTFS EXT4 FAT Windows Linux.

            </li>
            <li>Different options can be specified, as block size, number of files, quantity of data.

            </li>
            <li>It is free and open source with general public licence.

            Tiny C compiler ex: tcc -run overwrite.c 
        </p>

                <p>
         <strong>Overwrite user interface</strong> overwrite-ui.exe is written in C# programming language, 
            and also this program can be used in Windows and Linux.
        
          Requirements:

        <h2>Usage</h2>

        <pre>
Overwrite empty space on disk data and metadata.
Version 1.4 2019-11-02

USAGE: 
overwrite [-h -v -test -one -rand -block:] (-dirs: &| -data:) -path: 
  -h 		 Print help and usage message.

        <strong><u>Parameters</u></strong>
        <br />

        <dl>
            <dt>Test</dt>
            <dd>This parameter is used for testing, to analyze written directories and files. 

            </dd>
            <dt>One</dt>
            <dd>The data will be overwritten with one's, all bits set to one.

            </dd>
            <dt>Rand</dt>
            <dd>The data will be overwritten with random content, one and zero.

            </dd>
            <dt>Block</dt>
            <dd>Block size on every data write. 
                    Operating System write data in block/sector of bytes 
                    not in single bytes. This is important for overwrite because entire blocks has to 
                    be ovewritten.
                <br />
                Different File Systems may have different block size, NTFS and EXT4 
                (hard disk) have block 4096 bytes, FAT (USB Stick) has block 512 bytes.

                If the metadata is not overwritten the forensic software will see that

        <h2>How it works</h2>

        <p>
            Overwrite program write files and directories using operating system functions, 
            and in this way overwrite the remaining metadata and data on disk.

        </p>
        <p>
            When operating system delete file the file and space used by 
            it is marked as free for new files, 
            but the data is not cleaned and remain on disk, 
            so when the new files are written the remaining data is overwritten.

        </p>
        <p>
            The file system is similar to dictionary has metadata that is 
            summary information about the files and then data, writing many 
            directories overwrite metadata, and writing big file overwrite data, 
            that is what overwrite program does.

        </p>


        <h2>Side Effects</h2>
        <p>
            Overwrite of metadata is not always guaranteed, this depends on different factors as number 
            of files written, file system.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>FAT File System</strong>
            <br />
            For example on FAT file system metadata has to be overwritten in 
            the same directory of deleted files.  
            <br />
            Other effect on FAT file system is that it may need more entries overwritten 
            for long file names, for example to overwrite 5 entries in metadata 
            use parameter -dirs:10

        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>NTFS File System</strong>
            <br />

            <strong>Metadata should not be filled all at once</strong>
            , the parameter -dirs should be 
            number of files to overwrite for example 100, 1000, it is not good practice more 
            than 10.000.
            <br />
            NTFS file system metadata structure grow for maximum number 
            of files written at one point in time, when files are deleted 
            metadata entries are marked as free and ready for new files 
            but the space is not released.
