        <h1>Overwrite</h1>


        <p>
            Overwrite is a program that overwrites empty space on disk.
        </p>

        <img src="../../images/overwrite2.png" alt="Overwrite" />

        <p>
            The empty space on disks can contain sensitive data and informations that can be 
            recovered with recovery software and forensics, this can be 
           <strong>security and privacy risk</strong>.

        </p>

        <p>
            The operating systems and programs automatically write and delete data on disks, for example word processor save copies of the document for recovery and later deletes them.
            Also when users delete files they are only marked as deleted but the files remain on disk and can be recovered.
        </p>

        <p>
            To protect security and privacy the remaining data on empty space on disks has to be overwritten.
        </p>

        <p>
            To properly clean remaining data both metadata as file names and content has to be overwritten, this program has parameters as -files and -data that specify quantity of metadata and content that has to be overwritten.
        </p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It is safe, does not overwrite existing files, and uses operating system for overwrite.

            </li>
            <li>Can be used on different file systems and operating systems, as NTFS EXT4 FAT Windows Linux.

            </li>
            <li>Different options can be specified, as block size, number of files, quantity of data.

            </li>
            <li>It is free and open source with general public licence.

            </li>

        <h2>Usage</h2>

        <pre>
Overwrite empty space on disk, write number of small files and data.

USAGE:
overwrite [-h -test -one -rand -block:] (-files: &| -data:) -path:
  -h             Print help and usage message.
  -test          For test, don't delete written files.
  -one           Overwrite with 1, default with 0.
  -rand          Overwrite with random data, default with 0.
  -block         Block size, default 4096 bytes as NTFS and EXT4.
  -files         Number of files to write, block size each.
  -data          Quantity of data to write, ex: 1mb, 1gb, all.
  -path          Path to directory where to write data.

EXAMPLE:
# Write 10 files and 10Mb data, on NTFS
overwrite -files:10 -data:10mb -path:c:\

# Write random data, block size 512 bytes on FAT FS
overwrite -rand -block:512 -files:10 -data:10mb -path:/mnt/usbdisk/
